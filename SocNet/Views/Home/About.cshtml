            <h2>SocialNet</h2>
            <p>
                Our site was founded as a concept for a capstone project for a class at
                Northwestern Michigan College; the site was built as a final and is hosted on Azure
                so that others can view it and the creator can get her final grade.

            <p>
                The idea for this stemmed from the fact that many of the computer information technology classes
                required a certain number of hours of professional development and social networking to be
                completed in order to receive a certain percentile of the final grade; with this came a
                great deal of miscommunications and information being missed, leading to a small number of Forums
                being properly advised of.
                SocialNet is here to eliminate the hassle of spreading the word about Forums and projects by
                offering a centralized location to network and promote Forums - such as tech oriented get togethers and geek
                meetups.
